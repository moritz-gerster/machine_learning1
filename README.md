# Machine Learning 1 â€“ Master's Course
### Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin Â· Prof. Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller


This repository contains coursework from the **graduate-level Machine Learning 1** course taught by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin during the Winter Semester 2021/22. The course is part of the Masterâ€™s in Computer Science program and explores how machines can learn from data â€” from statistical foundations to modern AI techniques.

Assignments include both **analytical derivations** and **programming tasks**.

## Topics Covered
The course introduced a wide range of core machine learning methods, including dimensionality reduction, classification, model selection, neural networks, ensemble learning, clustering, and explainable AI:


1. **Bayes Decision Theory** â€“ Decision boundaries, loss functions, Gaussian classifiers
2. **Parameter Estimation** â€“ MLE, MAP, biasâ€“variance trade-off
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€“ Dimensionality reduction, eigen decomposition
4. **Fisher Discriminant** â€“ Linear classification, between/within-class scatter
5. **Model Selection** â€“ Overfitting, cross-validation, regularization
6. **Neural Networks I** â€“ Perceptrons, backpropagation, gradient descent
7. **Learning Theory & Kernels** â€“ VC dimension, margins, Mercer's theorem
8. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** â€“ Dual optimization, hard/soft margin
9. **Kernel Ridge Regression** â€“ Kernel trick, regularized least squares
10. **Boosting** â€“ AdaBoost, ensemble methods
11. **Decision Trees and Random Forests** â€“ Entropy, pruning, bagging
12. **Neural Networks II** â€“ Deep learning architectures
13. **Latent Variable Models / Clustering** â€“ K-means, EM, mixture models
14. **Explainable AI (XAI)** â€“ Feature attribution, interpretability

## Contents

The repository is organized into weekly folders (e.g., `Week01`, `Week02`, ...) following the course progression. Each folder typically contains:

- `Analytical_Homework.pdf` files with analytic derivations, proofs, and handwritten solutions
- `Programming_Homework.ipynb` files with programming assignments (Jupyter Notebooks)
